;;  About Company
;;  Company is a text completion framework for Emacs.
;;  The name stands for "complete anything".
;;  It uses pluggable back-ends and front-ends to retrieve and display completion candidates.
;;  It comes with several back-ends such as
;;  Elisp,Clang,Semantic,Eclim,Ropemacs,Ispell,CMake,BBDB,Yasnippet,dabbrev,etags,gtags,files,keywords
;;  and a few others.
;;  The CAPF back-end provides a bridge to the standard COMPLETION-AT-POINT-FUNCTIONS facility,
;;  and thus works with any major mode that defines a proper completion function.

;;; Code:

;; WAITING: haskell-mode sets tags-table-list globally, breaks tags-completion-at-point-function
;; TODO Default sort order should place [a-z] before punctuation
